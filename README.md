# Marble Mania



## About

Both myself and my partner for this project [Kevin An](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-yukai-an/) love rhythm games. In fact he has his own Dance Dance Revolution mat at home! This had us thinking: Why not just make our own? In the modern age many rhythm games are already digital, and it's pointless to try and compare.

Hence we decided to physically recreate one of the most popular digital rhythm games: osu! (specifically [osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Game_mode/osu%21mania)). We made it physical by representing the notes as marbles falling down ramps and instead of buttons on a keyboard mechanical pushers to hit the marbles away from miss detection.
